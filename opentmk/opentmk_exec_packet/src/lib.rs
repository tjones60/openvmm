//! This contains the packet API library used for communication between a UM agent
//! and opentmk components.
//!
//! In general, a communication channel between the agent and opentmk works first by
//! establishing a three-way-handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) which is entirely just a magic number
//! being exchanged between the two parties. Currently we assume that the agent would start the
//! communication.
//!
//! Then after that, packets of type [`OpenTMKPacket`], with corresponding magic header and footer
//! value (defined in [`COMMS_PACKET_HEADER_MAGIC`] and [`COMMS_PACKET_FOOTER_MAGIC`]) will be
//! exchanged as the agent executes test cases. Usually this is done with sending a single
//! configuration packet followed by a back and forth exchange of test case packets with the
//! opentmk ack'ing each packet.
