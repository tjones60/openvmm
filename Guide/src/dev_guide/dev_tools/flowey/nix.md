# Nix

In order to enable reproducible builds, experimental flowey features are being built to utilize the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) for dependency management and environment isolation.
The root of the nix configuration lives in `shell.nix`. If you're unsure where the Nix definition is for a dependency, you should be able to track it down from there.

## Updating Nix Packages

Nix dependencies require a hash of their contents to ensure integrity and reproducibility. When updating a dependency, you'll need to update the release that's being pulled and its corresponding hash.

For instance, let's say we have a new release of the OpenHCL Kernel and we want to update it in our Nix configuration:

1. Go to the corresponding `.nix` file (in this case, `openhcl_kernel.nix`)
2. Clear the hash to an empty string
3. Update the version
4. Run `nix-shell --pure` and use the printed error to get the new hash

> **Warning:** Because Nix caches dependencies based on the hash, if you don't clear the hash to an empty string before updating the version, `nix-shell --pure` will run without error even though the dependency hasn't actually been updated.

Here's an example of what the error will look like when done correctly:

```bash
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/cc7hhyslx1dnw01nmjx11zqim2l50awp-source.drv':
         specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
            got:    sha256-wUDWFazJM80oztKqpuRwj8Wvto2Uo/OuVGvhpszIw+A=
error: Cannot build '/nix/store/spg5vbm6mzmsxpg5v2ibg97qrz8khc70-openhcl-kernel-x64-6.12.52.4.drv'.
       Reason: 1 dependency failed.
       Output paths:
         /nix/store/kv8s7pld70yvzxzd77swz9hb3pygkrhl-openhcl-kernel-x64-6.12.52.4
```

Given this error, you would update the corresponding hash to `sha256-An1N76i1MPb+rrQ1nBpoiuxnNeD0E+VuwqXdkPzaZn0=` in the `openhcl_kernel.nix` file.

### Updating `mu_msvm` UEFI (`nix/uefi_mu_msvm.nix`)

When bumping `mu_msvm`, update both the Nix fetch and the Flowey version
constant in the same PR.

1. Update `nix/uefi_mu_msvm.nix`:
    - Set `version` to the new release.
    - Ensure the `fetchzip` URL uses that version.
    - Set both architecture hashes to empty strings.
2. Update `flowey/flowey_lib_hvlite/src/_jobs/cfg_versions.rs`:
    - Bump `MU_MSVM` to the same version.
3. From the repo root, run `sudo nix-shell` (or `nix-shell` if sudo is not
  required in your environment).
4. Copy the first `got:` hash from the mismatch error into the matching entry
  in `nix/uefi_mu_msvm.nix`.
5. Run `sudo nix-shell` again to fetch the other architecture and copy its
  `got:` hash.
6. Re-run `sudo nix-shell` a final time to verify both hashes are correct.

Expected mismatch output:

```bash
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/...-source.drv':
      specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
        got:    sha256-<new hash from downloaded artifact>
```

Use the `got:` value in the `.nix` file.

### OpenHCL dev kernel packages

The Nix shell does not evaluate or export OpenHCL dev kernel packages by
default. The main and dev kernels often contain the same promoted changes, so
building both variants adds unnecessary download and build work.

To restore the dev kernel packages when the branches diverge:

1. Set `enableDevKernel` to `true` in `shell.nix`.
2. Update the dev version in `nix/openhcl_kernel.nix`.
3. Clear and replace the dev hashes using the procedure above.

This restores the `NIX_KERNEL_*_DEV` paths and
`CARGO_BUILD_ARGS_*_DEVKERN` arguments in the Nix shell.

## Updating the Rust Version

The Nix shell derives its Rust toolchain version from `rust-version` in the root `Cargo.toml` and resolves it against a pinned [rust-overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) commit in `shell.nix`. When `rust-version` is bumped in `Cargo.toml`, the pinned rust-overlay may not yet include the new version, causing an error like:

```bash
error: No rust version matching 1.XX.* found in rust-overlay
```

To fix this, update the rust-overlay pin in `shell.nix` to a commit that includes the new Rust version:

1. Go to the [rust-overlay stable branch commits](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay/commits/stable) and copy the latest commit SHA
2. In `shell.nix`, find the `rust_overlay` `fetchTarball` block and replace the commit SHA in the `url` with the new one (the long hex string in the URL path, e.g., `https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay/archive/<commit-sha>.tar.gz`)
3. Clear the `sha256` field to an empty string — this is a _content_ hash of the tarball (not the commit SHA), and Nix will compute the correct value for you
4. Run `nix-shell --pure` and use the printed error to get the new `sha256`
5. Update the `sha256` with the correct hash from the error
